The solution of the problem is a .netCore mstest project which tests "http://www.nbrb.by/API/ExRates/Currencies[/{Cur_ID}]" api 
To Build and run the autotests perform the following steps:
1. Clone the project: https://github.com/kupetsdenis/datetime_tests.git
2. Install the latest version .netCore 
3. Using command line open the folder where you have clonned the project (where the .csproj file is placed)
4. Execute command: "dotnet test"
